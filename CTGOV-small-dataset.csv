NCT03498625,Crohn's Disease Endoscopic REmission Definition in an Objective Way,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03498625,CREDO1,COMPLETED,"The CDEIS (Crohn's disease endoscopic index of severity) and its derivative, SES-CD (single endoscopic score for Crohn's disease) were constructed to evaluate the endoscopic severity of Crohn's disease (CD). The current therapeutic goal in CD is endoscopic remission, which is thought to be predictive of a favourable evolution of the disease. However, up to now there is no measure of endoscopic remission, objectively constructed and validated, not even a consensus for its definition. An objective measure of endoscopic remission is necessary, notably for the evaluation of new treatments, a request of the regulatory agencies (FDA and EMA), but also in clinical practice if one wishes to adapt the treatment of patient according to the level of endoscopic remission.

The aim of the study is to construct a measure of endoscopic remission based on an objective assessment (depth or grade) of remission, that must be reproducible, little or not dependent on the reader interpreting the endoscopy.

The CREDO 1 program is a cross-sectional study designed to construct objectively a measure of the endoscopic remission of CD through an index measuring its depth or a score measuring its grade and to evaluate its reproducibility.

This study is composed of four main parts:

1. Training and selection of readers:

   * Selection and definition of all lesions to be studied at consensus meetings, first between the central readers, then with the participation of local investigators.
   * Specific training of local investigators in the recognition of endoscopic lesions
   * Checking the performance of the central readers
2. Recruitment of patients by investigators - local readers:

   * Inclusion criteria: CD diagnosed for more than 6 months, in clinical remission for at least 3 months, with a Crohn's disease activity index \< 150 at the time of endoscopy.
   * Each local investigator will have to record 15 videos divided according to his/her overall judgment into 3 status of remission: Complete Remission; Remission almost complete; Remission neither complete nor nearly complete.
   * The colon will be divided into 7 segments: ileum, ileocecal valve, right colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum. Each segment will be identified by landmarks.
   * Videos will be anonymized and then centralized at a healthcare provider (OVH - SAS).
   * 16 French and Belgian centers will participate in the study leading to a total of 240 films.
3. Analysis of videos by central readers:

   * 12 central readers will independently read 80 out of the 240 videos
   * Videos allocation to central readers will be performed through balanced incomplete block method to ensure that each central reader, as well as each central reader pair, has the same weight in achieving the results.
   * A quantitative evaluation of the depth of endoscopic remission on a visual analogue scale and a qualitative evaluation of the grade of remission on a 5-level ordinal scale will be provided by each central reader, segment by segment and globally, in addition to the description of all lesions identified by segment.
4. Analysis of the data recorded by the central readers:

   * An index (depth of remission) or score (grade of remission) will be constructed from linear or multiple logistic regression models, considering the reader and endoscopy as random factors, to take into account the dependence between the readings performed on different endoscopies by the same central reader or on the same endoscopy by different readers.
   * Variations in readings between central readers will be quantified through the Kappa coefficient for qualitative items and through the intraclass correlation coefficient for quantitative items.

In an observational longitudinal multi-center cohort study (CREDO 2), it will be tested whether the index or score thus constructed is able to predict prolonged clinical remission for 2 years in patients in clinical remission at baseline. If this test is successful, we will have a primary objective and reproducible criterion for evaluating treatments in CD and a useful tool for the management of these patients in clinical practice.",NO,CD,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Colonoscopy,"Building an objective definition of the depth or grade of endoscopic remission in relation to what is observed during endoscopy in CD patients presenting with clinical remission, 12 Central Readers, selected from the participating centers independent of the patient selection will be involved in the central reading process. They will have experience in IBD endoscopy and its evaluation and will be involved in the lesions' selection that need to be described during videos' readings. Videos allocation will be done by a randomized balanced incomplete block design. Each CR will review 80 videos and each video will be read by 4 CR (6 couples of 2 CR). The efficacy of this design is 0.90, meaning that this design has the same power than a complete design with a sample size reduced by 10% whereas the reading burden is reduced by 67% (80 instead of 240). Six videos, two of each remission status randomly selected, will be read a second time by the CRs to assess intra observer variability. The CR will provide the detection and quantification of the lesions in the endoscopic images, and a quantitative and qualitative remission evaluation, 1 Year","Intra- and inter-observer variability of what is observed during endoscopy in CD, For each observed segment, the central reader will first evaluate the quality of the bowel preparation and the recording, secondly the CR documents all lesions, detected or not, and quantified those detected, then the CR will perform his/her segmental endoscopic remission evaluation, qualitative on a 5-grade scale and quantitative on a linear analogue scale. Finally, after the readings of all segments, the CR will provide his/her global endoscopic remission evaluations, qualitative on a 5-grade scale and quantitative on a linear analogue scale. Each CR will review 80 videos and each video will be read by 4 CR (6 couples of 2 CR). Based on the this the inter-observer variability will be assessed. Six videos, two of each remission status randomly selected, will be read a second time in a random order by each of the 12 CRs to assess intra observer variability., 1 Year|Intra- and inter-observer variability of depth and grade of endoscopic remission in CD, For the quantitative evaluation, the CR had to:

* provide his/her evaluation of depth of remission per segment (ileum, ileocecal valve, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum) in marking a cross on a linear analog scale, with left extremity being absolutely no remission and right extremity being absolutely complete remission.

NCT02259231,RTA 408 Capsules in Patients With Melanoma - REVEAL,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02259231,,COMPLETED,"Malignant melanoma is a leading cause of death from cutaneous malignancies, accounting for approximately three-fourths of all skin cancer deaths. For metastatic or unresectable melanomas, standard treatment options include immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., ipilimumab and nivolumab) and other therapies, however, approved therapies are rarely curative.

It is now well accepted that tumors are able to evade detection and eradication by the immune system, even though many tumor types, particularly melanoma, are capable of eliciting a strong immune response (Swann, 2007). Substantial mechanistic work in recent years has revealed the key role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in masking cancer cells from the immune system, promoting both tumor progression and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. The immune-suppressive effect of MDSCs is dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). High levels of these reactive molecules and their by-products, such as nitrotyrosine, have been correlated with poor clinical outcomes in melanoma. Currently available melanoma therapies do not target MDSCs.

In animals, RTA 408 significantly reduces tumor nitrotyrosine burden, inhibits the activity of MDSCs, and augments T-cell anticancer activity at relevant doses. Thus, through inhibition of MDSC activity and suppression of tumor ROS/RNS, RTA 408 may work in combination with T-cell-activating therapeutics such as ipilimumab to enhance the natural immune anticancer response. RTA 408 also has direct anticancer effects via inhibition of NF-kappa B. Chronic activation of NF-kappa B is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy.

This proposed study is designed to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

In this open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, Phase 1b/2 study, patients who qualify will receive omaveloxolone (RTA 408) at the assigned dose level in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab. Patients will receive omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily for 1 week prior to initiation of ipilimumab or nivolumab. For patients treated with ipilimumab , the run-in period will be followed by omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily in combination with ipilimumab administered at Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. After Week 10, patients will receive maintenance treatment with omaveloxolone (RTA 408) alone once daily. For patients treated with nivolumab, the run-in period will be followed by omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily in combination with nivolumab administered approximately every two weeks as clinically indicated. Each patient will continue at the assigned omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose level until disease progression occurs, toxicity requiring discontinuation from study drug (i.e., RTA 408) is experienced, the patient has completed approximately 72 weeks of treatment, the patient is discontinued from the study drug for another reason, or the patient withdraws consent. Patients will return 4 weeks after omaveloxolone (RTA 408) treatment completion for a follow-up visit.

The starting omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose level for the first dose-escalation cohort in this study has been selected based on available safety and pharmacodynamic data from a Phase 1 study of RTA 408 (NCT02029729). Subsequent cohorts will be enrolled at dose levels based on available safety and PD data from this study, but they will not be greater than 2-fold above the prior dose level.

Phase 1b (dose-escalation): In the phase 1b/2 portion of this study, 12 patients will be enrolled in each dose cohort, with six patients administered omaveloxolone (RTA 408) plus ipilimumab and the remaining six administered rTA 408 plus nivolumab. Subsequent cohorts will assess escalating the doses of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) administered in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab. Dose escalation decisions will be based on ongoing review of all available safety information for enrolled patients.

Phase 2: The Phase 2 portion of the study may include separate expansion cohorts consisting of patients treated with either of the combination therapies. Each expansion cohort will include an additional 24 patients enrolled at the selected Phase 2 dose level to achieve a total of 30 patients at that omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab.",YES,Melanoma|Unresectable (Stage III) Melanoma|Metastatic (Stage IV) Melanoma,DRUG: Omaveloxolone Capsules (2.5 mg/capsule)|DRUG: Ipilimumab (3 mg/kg)|DRUG: Nivolumab (240 mg)|DRUG: Omaveloxolone Capsules (10 mg/capsule)|DRUG: Omaveloxolone Capsules (50 mg/capsule),"Measure of Efficacy of the Phase 2 Dose of RTA 408 in Combination With Nivolumab Using Overall Response Rate (ORR; Complete Plus Partial Responses) According to RECIST Version 1.1 Criteria, Best overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with complete or partial tumor size reduction according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. Stable disease is not a component of ORR.

Complete response: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial reduction: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

The first occurrence of a response is considered an unconfirmed response. A CR or PR which persists to the next tumor burden assessment is then considered a confirmed response. Confirmed plus unconfirmed best overall response are presented. A subject may be counted twice if best unconfirmed response and best confirmed response are different., From enrollment up to the time of disease progression, up to 172 weeks for participants receiving Omaveloxolone in combination with Ipilimumab and 173 weeks for participants receiving Omaveloxolone combination with Nivolumab",,,Biogen,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,41,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,RTA 408-C-1401,2014-10-31,2018-05-09,2018-07-23,2014-10-08,2021-04-30,2023-11-01,"Southern Cancer Center, Mobile, Alabama, 36608, United States|Highlands Oncology Group, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 72703, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center, Anschutz Cancer Pavilion, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Christiana Hospital Helen F.

Recombinant soluble CD4 protein (rCD4) is a drug that has been produced by genetic engineering techniques. In laboratory studies, rCD4 binds to HIV and reduces its ability to enter the cell, thus inhibiting its reproduction. Before rCD4 can be tested for therapeutic effectiveness in HIV-infected patients, it is necessary to determine the maximum dose that can be tolerated by humans. AMENDED: To date, Biogen's original sequence recombinant soluble CD4 and Biogen's natural sequence recombinant soluble CD4 have both been referred to as recombinant soluble CD4 (rsCD4). In order to distinguish between these two products, a change in nomenclature has been made. In this protocol, whenever the original sequence CD4 molecule is referred to, it is called recombinant soluble T4 (rsT4). Whenever the natural sequence molecule (currently under study in this protocol) is referred to, it is called BG8962 or rCD4.

NCT04552379,The Containing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04552379,ConCorD-19,COMPLETED,"In recent months severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a novel human pathogen and, susceptibility amongst humans is presumed to be universal. Prevention measures of COVID-19 have included distancing, quarantines, use of facemasks in public places, and hand hygiene measures. Mandatory quarantines have also been applied on index cases and their contacts, as well as an active search for asymptomatic patients.

Current strategies to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 do not include measures that could prevent transmission prior to the onset of symptoms. Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been known to shed virus and be contagious for up to 5 days prior to developing symptoms ('pre-symptomatic transmission'). In fact, nearly 60% of all infected subjects can shed virus pre-symptomatically. Pre- or even asymptomatic shedding occurs across all age groups, contributing to the rapidly expanding pandemic.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) using type 1 interferon (IFN) can potentially eliminate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. IFN could reduce the period of viral shedding by \~1 week. Since pre-symptomatic shedding of virus can start up to 5 days prior to symptom onset, our approach of a PEP intervention to all contacts recently exposed to a case could possibly entirely interrupt the spread of the virus, and with that, the pandemic. The current study focuses on prevention of the disease in addition to its treatment. Thus, the key distinction between these other trials and this study is that this study focuses on containing coronavirus (i.e. cause) in the community, rather than simply its treatment (i.e. consequence) in the individual.

Viral spread could be eliminated through interventions effective at abolishing viral transmission. However, such post-exposure prophylaxis interventions, that is initiation of antiviral therapy in pre-infectious contacts to reduce or even eliminate such spread, must be safe since they are given to asymptomatic and possibly uninfected subjects. In none of the previous clinical trials of IFN therapy for SARS-CoV-2 have serious adverse events been recorded. Furthermore, the IFN chosen for this study (pegylated IFN 1b) has been extensively studied in clinical trials, and has been in clinical use for years for multiple sclerosis. Pegylated IFN formulations allow for weekly injections while maintaining serum levels and limiting dose-dependent side effects. Together these data support a sound safety profile for the planned intervention.

The aim of this study is to ascertain whether IFN administered to index cases and household contacts of an index case, starting immediately following confirmed exposure (index case confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2), will reduce duration of SARS-CoV-2 detectable by PCR in the index cases, and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detectable by PCR in household contacts.",NO,SARS-CoV Infection|Interferon|Covid19,BIOLOGICAL: Peginterferon beta-1a,"The proportion of index cases shedding SARS-CoV-2, at Day 11, in the active arm compared to the standard of care arm., Day 11|The proportion of household contacts shedding SARS-CoV-2, at Day 11, in the active arm compared to the standard of care arm., Day 11","Duration (in days) of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR of samples taken on study days 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, and 29., Days 1,6,11, 21 and 29|Number of household contacts of participants in the IFN arm with positive upper airway PCR compared to that in the standard of care arm at day 1 & 11, and seroconversion (Ig) over the study period, up to day 29., Days 1,11 and 29|The proportion of infected cases in the active arm that are hospitalised or die due to COVID-19, as compared to the proportion in the standard of care arm., Days 1 to 29|Incidence and severity of reported adverse events in the interferon arm compared to the standard of care arm., Days 1 to 29",,Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,Telethon Kids Institute,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1173,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,200703013,2020-12-01,2021-05-31,2021-06-30,2020-09-17,,2021-09-10,"Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile",

1. Determine whether a measureable change in bacterial species representation follows the institution of DMF.
2. Determine whether a specific pattern of change in the microbiota phylotype with DMF therapy correlates to onset and severity of gastrointestinal disturbances (heartburn, nausea, flatulence, and diarrhea).
3. Determine whether any instability of microbiota phylotype representation persists following the institution of DMF or whether stabilization relates to resolution of gastrointestinal disturbances.
4. Determine whether there is a correlation between a pre-existing functional bowel disorder and development or severity of gastrointestinal disturbances and of peripheral eosinophilia.

Objectives: Subjects currently on any of the three b-IFN preparations (Avonex (Interferon b-1a 30 mcg IM Q 7 days), Rebif (Interferon b-1a 22 or 44mcg SC TIW), or Betaseron (Interferon b-1b 250mcg SC QOD)) will be enrolled to one of 3 groups:

Group 1: Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled who are NAb+ (titer ³ 20NU/ml) Group 2: Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled who are BAb- (titer \<8U) and NAb- (titer \<20 NU/ml) Group 3: Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled who are BAb+ (titer ³8U) and NAb- (titer \<20 NU/ml)

The primary objective of this study is to compare baseline b-IFN induced MxA mRNA response in neutralizing antibody positive (NAb+, titers ³ 20NU/ml, Group 1) vs. antibody negative (NAb-, titers \< 20NU/ml, BAb-, titers \<8U, Group 2) patients.

Secondary objectives are:

1. To compare b-IFN induced MxA mRNA response in neutralizing antibody positive (NAb+, titers ³ 20NU/ml, Group 1) vs. antibody negative (NAb-, titers \< 20NU/ml, BAb-, titers \<8U, Group 2) patients at the month 6 visit.
2. To compare b-IFN induced biomarker response (viperin, IFIT1) in neutralizing antibody positive (NAb+, titers ³ 20NU/ml, Group 1) vs. antibody negative (NAb-, titers \< 20NU/ml, BAb-, titers \<8U, Group 2) patients (data compared at baseline and month 6 visits)
3. To compare b-IFN induced biomarker response (MxA, viperin, IFIT1) in neutralizing antibody positive (NAb+, titers ³ 20NU/ml, Group 1) vs. BAb+ (titers ³8U)/NAb- (titers \<20 NU/ml, Group 3) patients at baseline and month 6 visits.
4. To correlate NAb titer levels with b-IFN induced biomarker response (data taken from baseline and month 6 visits from Group 1).
5. To compare b-IFN induced biomarker response (MxA, viperin, IFIT1) in BAb-/NAb- patients (Group 2) vs. BAb +/NAb- patients (Group 3) in order to determine if BAbs affect b-IFN induced biomarker response (data compared at baseline and month 6 visits).

Tertiary objectives are:

1. To explore patient characteristics that may predict NAb positivity.

Design: This is a multi-center, open-label study of approximately 300 (200 NAb+ and 100 NAb- (50 BAb+ and 50 BAb-)) MS patients that will compare b-IFN induced biomarker response following b-IFN injection in neutralizing antibody positive vs. antibody negative patients.

Study Population: Approximately 300 subjects (200 in Group 1, 50 in Group 2, and 50 in Group 3) will be recruited for the study.

Inclusion Criteria: To be eligible for entry into this study, candidates must meet all of the following eligibility criteria at the time of randomization:

1. Patients (male or female) diagnosed with relapsing forms of MS.
2. Currently being treated with the same b-IFN (in accordance with FDA approved dosing and schedules) for 12 to 48 months inclusive.
3. All levels of disability
4. Age 18-65 years inclusive
5. Subjects must be willing to be followed for the 6-month study period.

Exclusion Criteria: Candidates will be excluded from study entry if any of the following exclusion criteria exist at the time of study initiation.

1. Patients with prior b-IFN NAb test (whether positive or negative).
2. Patients who are currently being treated or have been treated within 6 months prior to screening with combination therapy (b-IFN plus any other immunosuppressant/immunomodulatory) other than IV steroids (either pulse or for a relapse).
3. Unwillingness or inability to comply with the requirements of this protocol including the presence of any condition (physical, mental, or social) that is likely to affect the subject's ability to comply with the study protocol.
4. Any other reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is determined to be unsuitable for enrollment into this study.

Treatment Groups: This is a multi-center, open-label study of approximately 300 (200 NAb+ patients and 100 NAb- patients (50 BAb+ and 50 BAb-)) relapsing MS patients that will compare b-IFN induced biomarker response following b-IFN injection in neutralizing antibody positive vs. antibody negative patients.

NCT02142959,RTA 408 Lotion in Patients at Risk for Radiation Dermatitis - PRIMROSE,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02142959,,COMPLETED,"Radiation dermatitis is experienced by almost all patients (up to 95%) receiving radiation therapy for cancer. Radiation dermatitis can be a serious condition because, in addition to its direct physical complications and the resulting impact on overall quality of life, it can also be a dose-limiting toxicity requiring changes to the prescribed course of radiation therapy. The most common strategy employed in an attempt to prevent or minimize radiation dermatitis involves moisturization of the irradiated area, use of a mild soap to keep the area clean, and minimizing exposure to potential mechanical irritants, such as scratching and rough clothing. However, this strategy has been shown to lack clinically significant efficacy. Consequently, there is a clinical need for new treatments that are effective in protecting against radiotherapy-induced oxidative stress and the subsequent development of radiation dermatitis.

Based on data from previous studies in animals and humans, Reata believes that omaveloxolone (RTA 408) Lotion may effectively prevent and mitigate radiation dermatitis in oncology patients undergoing radiation therapy.

This randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group trial will study the efficacy, tolerability and safety of two concentrations of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) Lotion (3% and 0.5%) versus vehicle in patients with breast cancer for whom radiation therapy is recommended.",YES,Breast Cancer,DRUG: Omaveloxolone Lotion 0.5%|DRUG: Omaveloxolone Lotion 3%|DRUG: Vehicle Lotion|RADIATION: 3D conformal radiation therapy,"Time-averaged Effect on Radiation Dermatitis Grade Measured With Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v 4.03) Following 3D Conformal Radiation Therapy to the Breast Following Topical Application of Omaveloxolone Lotion or Lotion Vehicle, CTCAE Radiation dermatitis scoring:

NCT04870203,Combination of Baricitinib and Anti-TNF in Rheumatoid Arthritis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04870203,CRI-RA,RECRUITING,"As stated by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Société Française de Rhumatologie (SFR), treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should target sustained remission or at least low disease activity. However, despite significant advances based on various combinations of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic DMARDs, RA therapies meet treatment goals only in some patients:

* 40 to 50% of patients with early RA, treated with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy as first-line therapy,
* 20 to 30% of patients treated with a combination of MTX and biologic as second-line therapy.
* Less than 10% of patients treated with a combination of MTX and another targeted DMARD, such as baricitinib, as third-line therapy.

Therefore, new strategies targeted at achieving a higher percentage of remission are needed, that do not require waiting for multiple failed therapies. Combinations of biologics have shown synergistic improvement of symptoms in murine models of RA relative to the improvement observed with either agent alone. However, in RA patients, only five randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have explored the efficacy and safety of combining tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor with another biologic (anakinra, abatacept, rituximab or bimekizumab).

Baricitinib is a selective, reversible and competitive inhibitor of Janus kinases (Jaki). This treatment is efficient in a number of therapeutic scenarios in RA and showed a clinical superiority over adalimumab in one RCT (RA-BEAM study in MTX inadequate responders). Of note, baricitinib inhibits many of the pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of RA but does not block signalling downstream of TNF. Owing to the interest in combining different mechanisms of action, the investigators plan to assess the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with baricitinib and a TNF inhibitor. The investigators are aware that combining targeted therapies is not recommended due to a potential increase in the frequency of serious adverse events. However, several case series on patients treated with a combination of targeted therapies have been published, suggesting a certain efficacy in patients with refractory RA. The first ones focused on inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis, but more recently, combination of tofacitinib (which belongs to the same Jaki family as baricitinib) with various biologics has been reported in a sample of RA patients. No serious adverse effects were reported over a mean of approximately 11 months of therapy. The clinical improvement was mild but noticeable in these refractory RA cases.

Recently, data of interest from the RA-BEAM study have been reported. Patients who switched from adalimumab to baricitinib showed improvements in disease control. Because the switch from adalimumab to baricitinib occurred without a washout period, and because adalimumab has a mean circulating half-life of approximately 14 days, patients would have received several weeks of dual TNF and Jak1/Jak2 inhibition in the course of the change of treatment. The observation of increased efficacy, with no apparent acute safety issues during the weeks when patients were exposed to both adalimumab and baricitinib, is of interest, and supports our strategy to combine the two treatments for patients with refractory RA.

The investigators consider that there is a need for investigation into the addition of anti-TNF to baricitinib in patients suffering of refractory RA (inadequate response to TNF inhibitors). The investigators hypothesize that in this population, based on ACR50 score, this combination therapy will decrease disease activity more efficiently than a switch to another targeted DMARD, such as baricitinib.",NO,Rheumatoid Arthritis,DRUG: baricitinib treatment|DRUG: adalimumab|DRUG: Placebo,"Proportion of patients who achieve an ACR 50 response, in each treatment group (COMBI group (anti-TNF therapy + baricitinib) vs. MONO group (baricitinib conventional therapy))., At weeks 24 after baseline","Proportion of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) in each treatment group, weeks 52 after baseline (Day 0)|Proportion of patients who achieve an ACR20 response in each treatment group, At weeks 4, 12 and 24 after baseline (Day 0)|Proportion of patients who achieve an ACR70 response in each treatment group, At weeks 4, 12 and 24 after baseline (Day 0)|Proportion of patients who achieve an ACR50 response in each treatment group, At weeks 4 and 12 after baseline (Day 0)|Proportion of patients who present a EULAR response according to DAS28-ESR, in each treatment group, at weeks 4, 12 and 24 after baseline (Day 0)|Proportion of patients who achieve remission or low disease activity according to DAS28-ESR in each treatment group, at weeks 4, 12 and 24 after baseline (Day 0)|Quantitative change in DAS28-ESR score (Disease Activity Score on 28 joints using Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) in each treatment group of treatment, varying from 0 to 9.55 with higher score means worse outcome., between baseline and each visit (until week 24 included)|Quantitative change in DAS28-CRP score between baseline and each visit (until week 24 included) in each treatment group of treatment, varying from 0.96 to 9.04 with higher score means worse outcome., Disease Activity Score on 28 joints using C-Reactive Protein level (DAS28-CRP), between baseline and each visit (until week 24 included)|Quantitative change in sDAI score (simplified Disease Activity Index) between baseline and each visit (until week 24 included) in each treatment group of treatment, varying from 0 to 100 with higher score means worse outcome., between baseline and each visit (until week 24 included)|Quantitative change in cDAI score (clinical Disease Activity Index) between baseline and each visit (until week 24 included) in each treatment group of treatment, varying from 0 to 76 with higher score means worse outcome., between baseline and each visit (until week 24 included)|Proportion of patients who decrease the glucocorticosteroid dose ≤ 5 mg per day, sustained from week 12 to week 24, among patients with a baseline dose > 5 mg per day, in each treatment group., At baseline (Day 0) and weeks 24 after baseline (Day 0)|Drug retention rates in each treatment group, at weeks 4, 12 and 24 after baseline (Day 0)|Quantitative change in patient-reported outcome in each treatment group Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), varying from 0 to 3 with higher score means worse outcome., between baseline, weeks 4, 12 and 24 visit|Quantitative change in patient-reported outcome in each treatment group, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACID), between baseline, weeks 4, 12 and 24 visit|Quantitative change in patient-reported outcome in each treatment group Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease questionnaire (RAID), varying from 0 to 10 with higher score means worse status., between baseline, weeks 4, 12 and 24 visit|Proportion of participants maintaining an ACR50 response, remission or low disease activity in each treatment group., at week 52 after baseline (Day 0)|Quantitative change in DAS28-ESR score (Disease Activity Score on 28 joints using Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) in each treatment group, varying from 0 to 9.55 with higher score means worse outcome., between weeks 24 and 52 after baseline (Day 0)|Quantitative change in DAS28-CRP score (Disease Activity Score on 28 joints using C-Reactive Protein level) in each treatment group, varying from 0.96 to 9.04 with higher score means worse outcome, between weeks 24 and 52 after baseline (Day 0)|Quantitative change in sDAI score (simplified Disease Activity Index) in each treatment group, varying from 0 to 100 with higher score means worse outcome., between weeks 24 and 52 after baseline (Day 0)|Quantitative change in cDAI score (clinical Disease Activity Index) in each treatment group, varying from 0 to 76 with higher score means worse outcome., between weeks 24 and 52 after baseline (Day 0)",,"University Hospital, Bordeaux","Eli Lilly and Company|Biogen|Ministry for Health and Solidarity, France",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,178,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CHUBX 2019/56,2021-07-15,2025-07,2025-07,2021-05-03,,2023-07-06,"CH de la Côte Basque -

Volociximab is an anti-angiogenic integrin inhibitor being developed for the treatment of solid tumors. Preclinical data with a surrogate volociximab antibody administered as monotherapy indicate encouraging efficacy in terms of tumor reduction and anti-angiogenic effects in mouse ovarian cancer xenograft models. In clinical studies, volociximab has been evaluated in several solid tumor types, including pancreatic, renal, and melanoma, with many subjects who entered the studies with progressive disease remaining progression-free for several months. In all studies in solid tumors, volociximab has shown a favorable safety profile when administered at 10 mg/kg q2wks and more recently at 15 mg/kg qwk. A study of volociximab in combination with liposomal doxorubicin in subjects with ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer who have relapsed after prior platin/taxane therapies is warranted to further evaluate the drug's efficacy and safety.

The PSP cognitive composite battery includes 13 sub-tests in total: 11 tests from the RBANS (only the picture naming is excluded), letter number sequencing test, and phonemic fluency test. Three domains are identified: Memory and learning, Visual-Motor function, and Working memory and Executive. A z-score transformation is applied for each component test at each visit, and the final total composite z-score is the average of the three-domain z-scores. A z-score of 0 is equal to the estimated mean adjusted by age and is considered average for this study population. Lower values are indicative of cognitive decline. A negative change from baseline indicates worsening., Baseline, Week 52|Change From Baseline in Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Disease Severity (RBANS) Scale at Week 52, The RBANS provides both a total scale score and scores for 5 different cognitive domains. Specifically, the test measures immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional ability, language, attention, and delayed memory. Scores from all subtests are aggregated into a total composite score. RBANS data were age-normed and analyzed as index scores (also referred to as standard scores), which have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Higher scores on each sub measure and index indicate better performance. A negative change from baseline indicates worsening., Baseline, Week 52|Change From Baseline in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Quality of Life Scale (PSP-QoL) Score, The PSP-QoL is a patient-reported outcome measure developed specifically for assessing the health-related quality of life in people living with PSP. It is validated 45-item questionnaire and visual analog scale that is comprised of 2 subscales: physical health state (22 items), which covers mobility, dysarthria, dysphagia, visual disturbances, self-care, and activities of daily living, and mental health state (23 items), which covers emotional, cognitive and social functioning. Items are given a 6-reponse option format (No Problem, Slight Problem, Moderate Problem, Marked Problem, Extreme Problem and Not Applicable). The subscale results are derived by summing the respective items for that subscale and transforming the scores into a range of 0 to 100, the higher the scores indicating a greater impact of the disease on the aspect measured. The PSP-QoL also comprises of a Life Satisfaction rating gauge, which is a visual analog scale with a range of 0 (worst) to 100 (best)., Baseline, Week 52|Change From Baseline in Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (SEADL) Scale Score at Week 48, The SEADL scale is a means of assessing a person's ability to perform daily activities in terms of speed and independence, with 100% indicating total independence, falling to 0%, which indicates a state of complete dependence. The individual is asked to rate his or her function using an 11-point scale (10% increments), from 100% (completely independent; able to do all chores without slowness, difficulty, or impairment; essentially normal; unaware of any difficulty) to 0% (vegetative functions such as swallowing, bladder and bowels are not functioning; bedridden). A negative change from baseline indicates worsening., Baseline, Week 48|Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Score at Week 52, The Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Rating evaluates the severity of individual symptoms and treatment response in participants with mental disorders. The CGI-S is a 7-point scale that that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment. A rating of 1 is considered normal, or with the least severe symptoms, a rating of 7 is extremely ill, or the worst symptoms., Baseline, Week 52|Change From Baseline in Phonemic Fluency Test Score at Week 48, Phonemic fluency is a sensitive test for assessing frontal lobe dysfunction. Participants are given a letter of the alphabet and asked to name as many words as they can that start with that letter in 1 minute. The score for each trial is auto-calculated as follows: Trial 1: Total number of correct responses for the first letter (range 0 to 40); Trial 2: Total number of correct responses for the second letter (range 0 to 40). The total score from the two trials will be used for analysis (range 0 to 80). More number of words correlates to better phonemic fluency. A negative change from baseline indicates worsening., Baseline, Week 48|Change From Baseline in Letter-Number Sequencing Test at Week 48, Letter number is a test of working memory which involves ordering a series of up to 8 letters and numbers in which the numbers are repeated back first in order starting with the lowest number, then followed by the letters in alphabetical order. LNS consists of 10 items and each item has 3 trials rated as Incorrect (0) or Correct (1). The LNS total raw score (range 0 to 30) is auto-calculated by summing the 10 individual item scores (range 0 to 3 for each item). Higher number of correct items correlated to better performance and a negative change from baseline indicates worsening., Baseline, Week 48|Change From Baseline in Color Trails at Week 48, The Color Trails test is a language free version of the Trail Making Test and was developed to allow for broader cross cultural assessment. For Part 1 (color trails test 1), the respondent uses a pencil to rapidly connect circles numbered 1-25 in sequence. For Part 2 (color trails test 2), the respondent rapidly connects number circles in sequence, but alternates between pink and yellow background. The length of time to complete each trial is recorded, along with qualitative features of performance indicative of brain dysfunction, such as near-misses, prompts, number sequence errors, and color sequence errors. Less time indicates better performance. A positive change from baseline indicates worsening., Baseline, Week 48|Change From Baseline in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Score at Week 48, The MOCA was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive function, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Scores on the MOCA range from 0-30, with higher score being better performance.

These functional systems are: pyramidal (ability to walk), Cerebellar (coordination), brain stem (speech and swallowing), sensory (touch and pain), bowel and bladder functions, visual, mental and Other (includes any other neurological findings due to MS). An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (disability) was calculated. Higher scores indicate greater disability., Day 1 (NCT02657915)|Severity of CNS Demyelinating Disease as Assessed Using the Symbol- Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), SDMT is a screening test for cognitive impairment. Participants were given 90 seconds in which to pair specific numbers with given geometric figures using a key. Scores range from 0 to 110 (best). Originate from the occipital cortex, the area of the brain involved in receiving and interpreting visual signals., Day 1 (NCT02657915)|Severity of CNS Demyelinating Disease as Assessed Using the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Assessment, MSFC has 3 component- timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), 9-hole peg test (9HPT) \[dominant and nondominant hands\] and (3-second) paced auditory serial addition Test (PASAT). The MSFC Z-score is calculated by creating Z-scores for each component of the MSFC and averaging them to create an overall composite score. MSFC Z-score = (Z25-foot-walk + Z9HPT + ZPASAT-3)/3, where Zj refers to Z-scores of component j. A Z-score represented the number of standard deviations participant's test result was higher (Z \>0) or lower (Z \<0) than the average test result (Z = 0) from the reference population.

NCT03662750,TSPO PET as a Measure of Post-stroke Brain Inflammation: a Natural History Cohort,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03662750,,COMPLETED,"DESIGN: exploratory, prospective, natural history, imaging cohort study

BACKGROUND: Stroke causes a strong inflammatory response in the brain which is thought to contribute to permanent brain damage in stroke patients. To develop new therapies targeting inflammation we need to better understand how inflammation affects the injured brain tissue and how it relates to neurological deficits that directly affect the patients' quality of life.

AIMS: To track the extent and location of inflammation in the brain after stroke over a period of 90 days. The study will explore whether the most inflamed areas in the brain undergo the most damage after stroke and correspond to the cognitive and neurological deficits experienced by stroke patients.

METHODS: The study involves an initial screening visit and 2 study imaging visits at days 15 and 90 after the stroke episode. Patients will undergo:

1. Two 90-minute brain imaging sessions using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (involves injection of safe radiotracers which attach to brain immune cell markers TSPOs and light up the inflamed areas in the brain),
2. Two 45-90 minute Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning sessions (include administration of safe chemical contrast agent Gadolinium),
3. Physical and neurological examinations (vital signs, assessments of mobility and cognitive functioning),
4. Blood testing (routine measurements, blood inflammation markers, and genetic testing for TSPO marker).

Venous cannula will be inserted into the forearm for the duration of the scans.

POPULATION: 15- 25 patients (recruitment will cease once 15 patients have completed the study)

ELIGIBILITY: Male and female stroke patients, aged 18-85, with a recent (within last 10 days) ischemic stroke of moderate severity, able and willing to provide informed consent

LOCATION: Patients will be recruited at the Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, and study scans will be performed by Invicro Centre for Imaging Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital

NCT05209815,Safety of Exposure to Natalizumab During Pregnancy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05209815,BABYZUMAB-2,RECRUITING,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) preferentially affects young adults with a female predominance. MS is not associated with an increased risk of complications or abnormal pregnancy outcomes. Nevertheless, disease-modifying therapies can have a teratogenic effect. Discussions about discontinuation should be made with a view to or upon discovery of pregnancy, taking into account the risk of untreated relapses and the risk of toxicity to the fetus.

Natalizumab (NTZ) is a humanized anti-alpha4-integrin monoclonal antibody used as a treatment for highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). When it is stopped, there is frequent reactivation of the disease with possible relapses and a rebound effect could occur. At present, depending on the center, attitudes of neurologist may vary and 3 main scenarios can be observed: Pregnancy and postpartum under NTZ (group1), Pregnancy partially under NTZ (with or without immunomodulator (IM) supplementation, group 2), or NTZ stopped before pregnancy (with or without IM supplementation, group3).

The first part of the BABYZUMAB study, a retrospective study of Natalizumab exposure during pregnancy, analysed the comparison the clinical activity of the disease (annualized relapse rate) according to these 3 scenarios of NTZ treatment The investigators analyzed the annual relapse rate (ARR) during a two-year period (9 months before and 15 months after the beginning of the pregnancy) in 117 patients identified in the OFSEP database. The investigators showed that the risk of relapses was four times higher in Group 2 versus Group 1 (p=0,014) and six times higher in Group 3 versus Group 1 (p=0,001).

NCT05645250,Feasibility of a Newborn Screening for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) in France: DEPISMA Prefigurator Project in Grand-Est and Nouvelle-Aquitaine,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05645250,DEPISMA,RECRUITING,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease of the nervous system that affects about 1 in 7,0001.2 births and results in very high mortality for patients with the disease. There are about 120 new cases in France each year and an estimated total of 2500 patients. It is the leading cause of genetic mortality in children in France. Until 2017, no etiological treatment was available. Currently, three treatments have been approved and have authorizations in France. The current clinical developments in SMA show the importance of an early treatment for patients. 3. The identification of pre-symptomatic patients is therefore essential to improve the effectiveness of treatments on an individual level and to avoid any loss of chance, as well as to reduce the societal cost of disability for patients treated in post-symptomatic. Several countries in Europe and around the world have implemented regional pilot screening programs for the disease. The screening test is based on a molecular genetic analysis that has been performed for many years, and which is highly reliable; there is currently no biochemical marker that can be used.

The objective of our project is to demonstrate the feasibility of neonatal screening for spinal amyotrophy in two French regions before being able to propose to extend it to the whole of France. The management of all screened patients will be decided outside the pilot study, by the existing national multidisciplinary consultation meeting, according to the best available standards of care and will be based on the national network of neuromuscular disease reference centers The objective of the project is not the evaluation of the efficacy of treatments or neonatal screening: these objectives are being studied by existing or otherwise ongoing studies around the world.

This project has been set up to be in line with the existing structures in France that are responsible for neonatal screening (via the regional neonatal screening centers (CRDN) and the regional perinatal networks) and for the management of rare diseases (via the neuromuscular disease reference centers and their FILNEMUS network). This project is performed in collaboration with AFM Telethon, Directorate of Health Care Supply, Regional Health Agency (ARS), FILNEMUS network, Novartis Gene Therapies, Roche Pharma AG,Biogen.

Following caregiver interview and systematic patient examination, the rater assigns a score describing the participant's current performance level in each of these domains of life functioning. Prespecified severity anchors range from none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2 to severe = 3 (the personal care domain omits the 0.5 score). ""Sum of boxes"" scoring methodology sums the score for each of the 6 domains and provides a value ranging from 0 to 18 that can change in increments of 0.5 or greater. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was used to analyze change from baseline in CDR-SB. A positive change from baseline indicates clinical decline., Baseline, Week 78","Change From Baseline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score at Week 78, The MMSE is a widely used performance-based test of global cognitive status. It consists of 11 tasks that assess orientation, word recall, attention and calculation, language abilities, and visuospatial functions. The scores from the 11 tests are combined to obtain the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores over time indicating increasing cognitive impairment. MMRM analysis was used to analyze change from baseline in MMSE.

NCT02255422,RTA 408 Capsules in Patients With Mitochondrial Myopathy - MOTOR,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02255422,,COMPLETED,"Mitochondrial myopathies are a multisystemic group of disorders that are characterized by a wide range of biochemical and genetic mitochondrial defects and variable modes of inheritance. Currently there are no effective treatments for this disease. Despite the heterogeneous myopathy phenotypes, a unifying feature of mitochondrial myopathies is that the pathogenic mtDNA mutations and/or nuclear mutations of the electron transport chain invariably lead to dysfunctional mitochondrial respiration. This reduction in mitochondrial respiration leads to a reduced ability to produce cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), often resulting in muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, and fatigue in patients with mitochondrial myopathies.

RTA 408 is a potent activator of Nrf2 and inhibitor of NF κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells), and thus induces an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phenotype. Several lines of evidence suggest that Nrf2 activation can increase mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis. Collectively, available data suggest that the ability of RTA 408 to activate Nrf2 and induce its target genes could potentially improve muscle function, oxidative phosphorylation, antioxidant capacity, and mitochondrial biogenesis in patients with mitochondrial myopathies.

Standard maintenance doses of immunosuppressive drugs and approved biological agents.

""No new features"" is defined as any new SLEDAI-2K component that was not present at the previous assessment. The SELENA-SLEDAI PGA Scale ranges from 0-3, where 0 is no disease activity and 3 is maximum disease activity. ""Standard maintenance doses"" include drugs limited to those allowed per protocol., Up to Week 180|Duration of Sustained LLDAS as Defined by the Number of Visits in LLDAS, LLDAS is a composite endpoint defined as the following:

i. SLEDAI-2K score ≤ 4, with no activity in a major organ system (renal, central nervous system, cardiopulmonary, vasculitis, fever); and ii. No new features of lupus disease activity compared with the previous assessment; and iii. SELENA-SLEDAI PGA ≤ 1; and iv. Current prednisone (or equivalent) dose ≤ 7.5 mg/day; and v. Standard maintenance doses of immunosuppressive drugs and approved biological agents.

""No new features"" is defined as any new SLEDAI-2K component that was not present at the previous assessment. The SELENA-SLEDAI PGA Scale ranges from 0-3, where 0 is no disease activity and 3 is maximum disease activity. ""Standard maintenance doses"" include drugs limited to those allowed per protocol., Up to Week 180|Annual Change From Baseline Value From the Parent Phase 3 Studies in Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI) Score, SDI score is used to assess the accumulated damage in participants with SLE. It assess 12 organ systems and records damage in participants with lupus, regardless of its cause. Damage could be due to previous disease activity, medication, or intercurrent illness (such as surgery or cancer). To distinguish between active inflammation and damage, an item must be present for at least 6 months. It is assumed that persistent inflammation (for at least 6 months) would result in tissue injury and hence damage. SDI is evaluated on a scale 0-47 with higher score indicating higher damage., Up to Week 156|Cumulative Exposure to OCS Over Time, Up to Week 156|Percentage of Participants With OCS ≤7.5 mg, Up to Week 156|Percentage of Participants With OCS ≤5 mg, Up to Week 156|Change From Baseline in Lupus-Specific Health-Related Quality-Of-Life (LupusQoL) Score, The LupusQoL is a participant-reported, lupus-specific, HRQoL questionnaire consisting of 34 items grouped in 8 domains: physical health, pain, planning, intimate relationships, burden to others, emotional health, body image and fatigue. Participants indicate their responses on a 5-point Likert response format, where 4 = never, 3 = occasionally, 2 = a good bit of the time, 1 = most of the time, and 0 = all the time. A LupusQoL score for each domain will be reported on a 0 to 100 scale, with greater values indicating better HRQoL., Up to Week 156|Change From Baseline in Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36) (Acute Version) Score, The SF-36 is a 36-item scale which assesses HRQoL in 8 domains: limitations in physical activities due to health problems, limitations in social activities due to physical or emotional problems, limitations in usual role activities due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general mental health (psychological distress and well-being), limitations in usual role activities due to emotional problems, vitality (energy and fatigue), general health perceptions. The SF-36 (Acute Version) form asks for participants to reply to questions (items) according to how they have felt over a specifically defined period of time. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the physical component summary (PCS) score of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the mental component summary (MCS) score of the SF-36 where higher scores indicate best health. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range: 0=worse health to 100=best possible health)., Up to Week 156|Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level Version (EQ-5D-3L), The EQ-5D is a standardized generic measure of health status developed by the European Quality of Life Group. This study uses the EQ-5D-3L version of the instrument. This instrument consists of 2 sections. The first section comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. All dimensions are measured on a 3-point scale, 1: No problems; 2: Some problems; 3: Extreme problems. The second section comprises the Visual Analogue Scale, which records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical scale ranging from 0 to 100, lower scores indicate the worst possible health state., Up to Week 156|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score, The FACIT-Fatigue is a participant-administered HRQoL questionnaire that evaluates participant's fatigue in 5 broad categories: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and additional concerns. The level of fatigue is measured by questions assessed on a 5-point scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). The responses for each item are added to obtain a total score which ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue., Up to Week 156|Change From Baseline in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Score, The PHQ-9 is a participant-administered HRQoL questionnaire to screen for the presence and severity of depression. The PHQ-9 is a participant-reported outcome (PRO) that is used to measure depression in adults. It contains 9 questions, with a 2 week recall period. The PHQ-9 yields an overall severity score that can range from 0 to 27 with the following severity scores: 0-4 = none; 5-9 = mild; 10-14 = moderate; 15-19 = moderate-to-severe; and 20-27 = severe., Up to Week 156|Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI):Lupus Score, WPAI questionnaire is a validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (work time missed) 2. Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment. Each score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity., Up to Week 156|Change from Baseline in Patient Global Assessment (PtGA) Score, The PtGA is participant-administered, single-item question evaluating the impact of health and illness, with responses ranging from very poor to very well on a 100 mm VAS. The participant will consider the previous week when addressing this question., Up to Week 156|Number of Participants with Clinically Relevant Abnormalities in Standard Laboratory Parameters, Standard laboratory parameters will include hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation., Up to Week 180|Number of Participants with Clinically Relevant Abnormalities in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Results, Up to Week 156|Number of Participants with Antibodies to Litifilimab, Up to Week 180",,Biogen,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,864,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",230LE306|2021-006378-22,2022-06-10,2029-03-13,2029-03-13,2022-04-29,,2023-09-15,"University of Alabama Hospital, Birmingham, Alabama, 35294, United States|Arizona Arthritis & Rheumatology Associates, P.C., Phoenix, Arizona, 85032, United States|Wallace Rheumatic Study Center, Beverly Hills, California, 90211, United States|University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California, 92037-094, United States|Valerius Medical Group, Los Alamitos, California, 90720-5403, United States|University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|Providence Facey Medical Foundation, Mission Hills, California, 91345, United States|Inland Rheumatology Clinical Trials, Inc., Upland, California, 91786, United States|Medvin Clinical Research, Whittier, California, 90606, United States|University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Georgetown University Hospital-Medstar, Washington, District of Columbia, 20007, United States|Arthritis & Rheumatic Disease Specialties, Aventura, Florida, 33180, United States|RASF - Clinical Research Center, Boca Raton, Florida, 33486, United States|Clinical Research of West Florida - Corporate, Clearwater, Florida, 33765, United States|Omega Research Consultants, DeBary, Florida, 32713, United States|Centre for Rheumatology, Immunology and Arthritis, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33309, United States|University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 32610, United States|GNP Research at Mark Jaffe, MD, Hollywood, Florida, 33024, United States|Life Clinical Trials, Margate, Florida, 33063, United States|University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|Rheumatology Associates of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, 32806, United States|Believe Clinical Trials, Ruskin, Florida, 33573-6801, United States|Clinical Research of West Florida, Inc., Tampa, Florida, 33606, United States|AdventHealth Medical Group, Tampa, Florida, 33613, United States|The Emory Clinic Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, 30303, United States|Jefrey Lieberman, M.D., P.C., Decatur, Georgia, 30033, United States|Arthritis Center of North Georgia, Gainesville, Georgia, 30501, United States|Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60612, United States|Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, 02118, United States|University of Massachusetts, Worcester, Massachusetts, 01605, United States|AA MRC LLC Ahmed Arif Medical Research Center, Grand Blanc, Michigan, 48439, United States|Washington University, School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Saint Louis Rheumatology, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63117, United States|Arthritis & Osteoporosis Associates, PA, Trenton, New Jersey, 08629-1986, United States|Arthritis and Osteoporosis Associates of New Mexico, Las Cruces, New Mexico, 88011, United States|NYU Langone Ambulatory Care Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, New York, 11201, United States|University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, 14642, United States|SUNY Upstate Medical Center, Syracuse, New York, 13210, United States|Joint and Muscle Research Institute, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28204, United States|DJL Clinical Research, PLLC, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28210, United States|Medication Management, LLC, Greensboro, North Carolina, 27405, United States|Carolina Arthritis Associates, Wilmington, North Carolina, 28401, United States|University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45242, United States|Paramount Medical Research & Consulting, LLC, Middleburg Heights, Ohio, 44130, United States|STAT Research, Springboro, Ohio, 45066, United States|Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Sayre, Pennsylvania, 18840, United States|Piedmont Arthritis Clinic, P.A., Greenville, South Carolina, 29601, United States|Low Country Rheumatology, PA, Summerville, South Carolina, 29486, United States|West Tennessee Research Institute, Jackson, Tennessee, 38305, United States|Ramesh C Gupta, MD, Memphis, Tennessee, 38119, United States|Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232-0028, United States|Office of John P.

Two pivotal trials show that app. 40% of MS patients with walking incapacity can improve walking speed averagely 25% when recieving the drug. This has been shown using the Timed 25 Foot Walk Test (T25FW). No effect on cognition and upper limb function has been shown, but this has not been investigated in patients responding to the drug measured by the abovementioned test.

The question is if this will be the case and also if another walking test, termed the Six Spot Step Test (SSST), will be more sensitive to the effect of Fampridine-SR.

In this study:

* Participants will take 225 milligrams (mg) of BIIB122 or a placebo as tablets by mouth. A placebo looks like the study drug but has no real medicine in it.
* Participants will take BIIB122 or placebo 1 time a day for up to a minimum of 48 weeks and a maximum of 144 weeks.
* Certain medications for PD will be allowed at enrollment for a subset of participants.
* The majority of clinic visits will be every 12 weeks. The main question researchers are trying to answer is if taking BIIB122 slows the worsening of symptoms more than placebo in the early stages of PD.

To help answer this question, researchers will use a questionnaire called the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, also known as the MDS-UPDRS. Researchers will use the MDS-UPDRS to learn about participant PD symptoms and how they affect their daily life.

NCT01816100,The Effect of Exercise on Strength and Mobility and Corresponding CNS Plasticity in Multiple Sclerosis Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01816100,remapping,COMPLETED,"This study is a unique blend of new technologies never used in combination with individuals diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The results of this research will define changes in brain activity, functional brain activation and diffusion in the brain following 6 months of structured weight resistance and balance training. Positive changes would indicate that the therapy has ignited brain plasticity and may drive the brain to repair itself. These changes to the brain may affect recovery as a result of neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, and slowing of neural degeneration. No other trials have been published evaluating brain plasticity utilizing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in subjects with MS undergoing physical training. DTI has demonstrated the ability to find changes (plasticity) that occur in the brain and using the MEG findings to focus the DTI analysis will optimize the capacity to detect changes secondary to therapy. This quantification will give a better understanding of the repair that goes on in the brain, and may potentially revolutionize the field of the central nervous system (CNS) rehabilitation. One of the most innovative aspects of this study is the full integration of clinical neurobehavioral metrics and functional imaging data in conjunction with a proven MS therapy along with quality of life indicators. This approach will allow new links to be illuminated as the trajectories of functional and structural brain changes (neuroplasticity) are meshed with clinical improvement indices collected visit-by-visit.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal assessment such as an abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. TEAE is any AE that start or worsen on or after the date of first dose of study treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose, results in death; in the view of the investigator places the participant at immediate risk of death; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; is a medically important event., From first dose to two weeks after last dose of study drug (Up to 98 weeks)|Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Vital Sign Abnormalities, Vital sign measurements included heart rate (low: \<=50 beats per minute \[bpm\] and decrease \>=15 bpm; High: \>=120 bpm and increase \>=15 bpm), systolic blood pressure (BP) (low: \<=90 millimeters of mercury \[mmHg\] and decrease \>=20 mmHg; High: \>=180 mmHg and increase \>=20 mmHg) and diastolic BP (low: \<=50 mmHg and decrease \>=15 mmHg; High: \>=105 mmHg and increase \>=15 mmHg)., From first dose to two weeks after last dose of study drug (Up to 98 weeks)|Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) Abnormalities, Potentially clinically significant QTcF values (\>450 to \<=480 millisecond \[msec\], \>480 to \<=500 msec) at any post-baseline visit during treatment period were reported., From first dose to two weeks after last dose of study drug (Up to 98 weeks)|Number of Participants With Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Score at Any Post-Baseline Visit, The C-SSRS is a clinician-administered instrument that systematically assess suicidal ideation and behavior rating scale. It rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation (SI) on a scale, ranging from ""wish to be dead"" to ""active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent."" The scale identifies SI severity and intensity, which may be indicative of an individual's intent to commit suicide. C-SSRS SI severity subscale ranges from 0 (no SI) to 5 (active SI with plan and intent). The scale identifies specific behaviors ranging from ""preparatory acts or behavior"" to ""suicide"" which may be indicative of an individual's intent to complete suicide., Up to 98 weeks|Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities, Laboratory assessments included hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis.

The relapse rate for an individual participant was calculated as the number of relapses for that participant divided by the number of participant-years followed. The ARR for each enrollment group was calculated as the total number of relapses experienced in the group divided by the total number of participant-years on study., Up to 96 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Relapse, Relapse was defined as new or recurrent neurologic symptoms, not associated with fever or infection, lasting for at least 24 hours, accompanied by one or more of the following: New objective neurological findings upon examination by the treating neurologist that are functionally consistent with findings on the EDSS (performed within 7 days of onset of symptoms) with an increase over the prior visit of ≥ 0.5 for the total score, an increase of ≥ 2 in 1 FS, except bladder/cognitive changes, and/or, an increase of ≥ 1 in 2 FS, except bladder/cognitive changes., Up to 96 weeks|Change From Baseline in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score, The EDSS is used to measure and evaluate MS participants' level of functioning. The EDSS provides a total score on a scale that ranges from 0 to 10. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability and the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refer to the loss of ambulatory ability. The range of main categories include (0) = normal neurologic examination; to (5) = ambulatory without aid or rest for 200 meters; disability severe enough to impair full daily activities; to (10) = death due to MS. Higher scores indicate more disability. Positive change from baseline indicates more disability., Baseline up to Week 96|Change From Baseline in Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (T25-FW) Score, The T25-FW is a reliable quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-foot walk. The participant was directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and was instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. Participants were allowed to use assistive devices (canes, crutches, walkers) as needed. The time was calculated from when the lead foot crosses the start point to when the participant had reached the 25-foot mark. The task was immediately administered again by having the participant walk back the same distance. The score for the T25-FW was calculated as the average of the 2 completed trials. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement., Baseline up to Week 96|Change From Baseline in the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level Visual Analog Scale (EQ-5D-5L VAS) Score, The EQ-5D-5L is an instrument designed to assess decrements in health. The EQ-5D-5L includes a VAS and a descriptive system that defines health in terms of 5 dimensions: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. Each dimension has 5 response categories corresponding to the level of severity (i.e., no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems). The EQ-5D-5L VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale numbered from 100 (best health imagined) to 0 (worst health imagined). Higher scores indicate good health. Positive change from baseline indicates improved health., Baseline up to Week 96|Change From Baseline in the EQ-5D-5L Index Score, The EQ-5D-5L is an instrument designed to assess decrements in health. The EQ-5D-5L includes a VAS and a descriptive system that defines health in terms of 5 dimensions: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. Each dimension has 5 response categories corresponding to the level of severity (i.e., no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems). The 5-item index score is transformed into a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state). Higher scores indicate good health. Positive change from baseline indicates improved health., Baseline up to Week 96|Change From Baseline in the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) Score, The SF-12 uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the study participant's perspective across eight domains: physical functioning, role, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Mental and physical composite scores (MCS \& PCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better health. Positive change from baseline indicates improved health., Baseline up to Week 96|Time to Onset of 12-week Confirmed Disability Progression, The time to onset of 12-week confirmed disability progression is defined as the time from baseline to the first disability progression that is confirmed at the next regularly scheduled visit ≥ 12 weeks after the initial disability progression. Disability progression is defined by one of the following: an EDSS increase of at least 1.5 points from baseline EDSS = 0, an EDSS increase of at least a 1.0 point from baseline EDSS between 1.0 and 5.5 (inclusive), or an EDSS increase of at least 0.5 points from baseline EDSS = 6.0., Up to Week 96|Percentage of Participants With No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA) at Week 96, The definition of NEDA-3 encompasses a combination of the following 3 related measures of disease activity: No relapses, no confirmed disability progression sustained for 12 weeks as measured on EDSS, and no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease activity, defined as no gadolinium-enhancing (GdE) lesions and no new or enlarging T2 lesions. The definition of NEDA-4 was the above definition of NEDA-3 with the addition of a mean annualized rate of brain volume loss of less than 0.4% where annualized rate of brain volume loss was derived

It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM-D, to be more sensitive than the Hamilton Scale to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment. Each item yielded a score of 0 to 6. The MADRS total score was calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores, which ranged from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS scores indicated more severe depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less severe depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more severe depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study., Baseline, Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 21 and 28|Change From Baseline in HAM-D Subscale Scores at Day 15 and All Other Time Points - Part A, HAM-D subscales were: Core, symptoms: depressed mood (DM), feelings of guilt (FG), suicide, work and activities (WA), and retardation (RE); Anxiety, symptoms: anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (SS) (gastrointestinal and general), hypochondriasis, and loss of weight; Bech-6, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, anxiety psychic (AP), and SS general; and Maier, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, agitation, and AP. Each item was scored in a range of 0 to 2 or 0 to 4. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. Subscale scores were calculated as sum of individual rating scores related to each subscale, divided by total possible score within subscale, multiplied by 100, and rounded to a whole number. Therefore, subscale scores would be within range of 0-100 and might be larger than total score. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of study., Baseline, Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 21 and 28|Change From Baseline (CFB) in HAM-D Individual Item Scores at Day 15 and All Other Time Points - Part A, The HAM-D comprised individual ratings of the following symptoms scored in a range of 0 to 2: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms \[gastrointestinal (GI) and general\], genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight.

Each of the 14 items was defined by a series of symptoms, and measured both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM-A was calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where 0-13=Normal, 14-17 Mild Anxiety, 18-24 Moderate Anxiety, \>=25 Severe Anxiety, per the Psych Congress Network. The HAM-A total score was calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores. A negative change from baseline indicated less anxiety. A positive change from baseline indicated more anxiety. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study., Baseline, Days 2, 3, 8, 15, 21 and 28|Percentage of Participants With Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Response - Part A, The CGI-I item employed a 7-point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the participant's condition post-treatment. The investigator rated the participant's total improvement whether or not it was due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. The CGI-I was only rated at post-treatment assessments. By definition, all CGI-I assessments were evaluated against baseline conditions.

During treatment session 3 on the 6th October 2009, one subject had a pattern of AEs of severe intensity, suggestive of brain stem toxicity / encephalopathy during the lidocaine/saline infusion period. Although recognised in the literature when lidocaine was used in patients for treatment of pain, these AEs were unusual in studies in healthy subjects. The study was suspended to allow re-evaluation of the risk:benefit balance of lidocaine/saline infusion in healthy subjects in this study.

NCT05418673,A Study to Assess if BIIB122 Tablets Are Safe and Can Slow Worsening of Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease in Participants With Specific LRRK2 Genetic Variants Between the Ages of 30 and 80 Using the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05418673,LIGHTHOUSE,TERMINATED,"In this study, researchers will learn more about a study drug called BIIB122 in participants with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD). The study will focus on participants with a specific genetic variant in their LRRK2 gene.

The main question researchers are trying to answer is if taking BIIB122 slows the worsening of PD more than placebo in the early stages of PD.

To help answer this question, researchers will use a questionnaire called the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, also known as the MDS-UPDRS.

* The MDS-UPDRS measures impairment and disability in people living with PD. It was created in the 1980s and is one of the most used rating scales for PD symptoms.
* The MDS-UPDRS has 4 parts, and a higher score means more severe PD symptoms.
* Part I assesses non-motor experiences of daily living, including but not limited to memory loss, problems sleeping, pain, depression, and anxiety.
* Part II measures motor experiences of daily living.
* Part III is the results of a motor symptoms exam by a medical professional.
* Part IV records PD complications caused by motor symptoms.

Researchers will also learn more about the safety of BIIB122.

A description of how the study will be done is given below.

* Participants will take BIIB122 or a placebo as tablets by mouth. A placebo looks like the study drug but contains no real medicine.
* Participants will be in the study for 103 weeks to 187 weeks. This includes the screening and follow-up periods.
* Participants will take BIIB122 or placebo 1 time a day for 96 to 180 weeks.
* Participants can continue to take certain medications for PD. Participants must be on the same dose of medication for at least 90 days before the study begins.
* Participants will visit the clinic less often as the study continues, ranging every 4 weeks to every 24 weeks.",NO,Parkinson Disease,DRUG: BIIB122|DRUG: BIIB122-Matching Placebo,"Time to Confirmed Worsening in Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts II and III Over the Treatment Period, Time to confirmed worsening is defined as a worsening event sustained over 2 consecutive assessments.

The study will focus on participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD.

The main question researchers are trying to answer is if BIIB080 can slow the worsening of AD more than placebo. It will focus on what dose of BIIB080 slows worsening of AD the most.

To help answer this question, researchers will use the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes, also known as the CDR-SB.

* Clinicians use the CDR-SB to measure several categories of dementia symptoms.
* The results for each category are added together for a total score. Lower scores are better.

Researchers will also learn more about the safety of BIIB080.

A description of how the study will be done is given below.

* Participants will receive either a low dose or high dose of BIIB080 or a placebo as an injection into the fluid around the spinal cord. A placebo looks like the study drug but contains no real medicine.
* The fluid around the spinal cord is called the cerebrospinal fluid.
* Participants will be in the study for 105 weeks, or a little over 2 years. This includes the screening and follow-up periods.
* Participants will be given BIIB080 or placebo once every 12 weeks for a total of 72 weeks.

Parts 1B and 2: To test for additive or synergistic activity between rsCD4 and AZT as judged by falls in HIV-1 p24 antigen levels; and to evaluate the safety of rsCD4 and AZT in patients with AIDS and advanced ARC.

AZT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of AIDS and advanced ARC but not without toxicity. The most clinically significant toxicity is dose related inhibition of bone marrow function. Furthermore, HIV-1 isolates from patients treated for more than 6 months with AZT have now been found which appear to have reduced sensitivity to AZT. The incidence of toxicity and occurrence of virus with reduced sensitivity to AZT may result in the inability to administer AZT long-term to patients with AIDS and advanced ARC.

NCT00027300,Safety and Efficacy of Natalizumab in the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00027300,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of natalizumab in the treatment of individuals who have been diagnosed with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). It is hoped that natalizumab will prevent certain types of white blood cells from moving out of the bloodstream into organs, including the brain, that are being damaged by autoimmune disease (a disease in which the body's own immune system attacks certain organs).

The secondary objectives of Part 1 of the study are to determine if BIIB093 improves overall survival at Day 90 when compared with placebo, if BIIB093 improves functional outcome at Day 90 on the mRS dichotomized 0-4 vs. 5-6 when compared with placebo, if BIIB093 reduces midline shift at 72 hours (or at time of decompressive craniectomy \[DC\] or comfort measures only \[CMO\], if earlier) when compared with placebo, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB093 in participants with LHI.

The objectives of Part 2 of the study are to evaluate long-term disability following LHI, to evaluate long-term outcome measures of clinical function, quality of life, and healthcare utilization, and to assess the safety of BIIB093 in subjects with LHI during the follow-up period.",NO,"Brain Edema|Stroke, Acute",DRUG: BIIB093|DRUG: Placebo,"Part 1: Percentage of Participants with Improvement in Functional Outcome at Day 90 Assessed via the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), mRS is a standardized interview that measures the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered causes of neurological disability. The score will be calculated as a 5-category ordinal scale. The 5-category mRS combines mRS categories 0 and 1 and mRS categories 5 and 6 (0/1, 2, 3, 4, 5/6).

It is a subjective questionnaire asked to the participant pertaining of 16 questions. Each question is rated 1-5 and then the scores are totalled. Total scores can range from 16-80 (16 means that none of the functional tasks asked can be performed, a score of 80 means the participant has no issues at all performing any of the tasks asked)., Month 6 and 12|Part 2: Zarit Burden Interview Score, The interview is developed to measure subjective burden among caregivers of adults with dementia. The 22-item self-report inventory examines burden associated with functional/behavioral impairments and the home care situation. The items are worded subjectively, focusing on the affective response of the caregiver. Scores range from 0 to 88 where lower scores indicate little to no burden. Higher scores indicate greater burden., Month 12|Part 2: HealthCare Resource Utilization (HCRU) Questionnaire: Number of Participants With Visits to Healthcare Professionals for Treatment, HCRU questionnaire will collect data on the healthcare resources used over the course of the study.

A negative change from baseline indicate decline in distance from FC to nearest border of AF., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in the Foveal Subfield Thickness Using Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) at Month 12 in Study Eye, SD-OCT was used to assess change in foveal subfield thickness. The measurements were taken after dilation of the participant's pupil. A negative change from baseline indicates decline in foveal subfield thickness., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in the Total Macular Volume Using SD-OCT at Month 12 in Study Eye, SD-OCT was used to assess change in total macular volume. The measurements were taken after dilation of the participant's pupil. A negative change from baseline indicates decline in total macular volume., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in the Central Horizontal Ellipsoid Width Using SD-OCT at Month 12 in Study Eye, SD-OCT was used to assess change in central horizontal ellipsoid width. The measurements were taken after dilation of the participant's pupil. A negative change from baseline indicates decline in central horizontal ellipsoid width., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in the Central Ellipsoid Area Using SD-OCT at Month 12 in Study Eye, SD-OCT was used to assess change in central ellipsoid area. The measurements were taken after dilation of the participant's pupil. A negative change from baseline indicates decline in central ellipsoid area., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in the Choroidal Thickness Using SD-OCT at Month 12 in Study Eye, SD-OCT was used to assess change in choroidal thickness. The measurements were taken after dilation of the participant's pupil. A negative change from baseline indicates decline in choroidal thickness., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in the Mean Retinal Sensitivity Using Microperimetry at Month 12 in Study Eye, Microperimetry was conducted to assess change in mean retinal sensitivity within the macula. Retinal mean sensitivity to light was measured in decibels (dBs) in multiple spots across the central and peripheral retina (entire visual field). Higher numbers (dBs) indicate higher retinal sensitivity. A negative change from baseline indicates decline in retinal sensitivity., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in the Bivariate Contour Ellipse Area 63% Using Microperimetry at Month 12 in Study Eye, Microperimetry was conducted to assess change in bivariate contour ellipse area 63%. A negative change from baseline indicates decline in bivariate contour ellipse area 63%., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in the Bivariate Contour Ellipse Area 95% Using Microperimetry at Month 12 in Study Eye, Microperimetry was conducted to assess change in bivariate contour ellipse area 95%. A negative change from baseline indicates decline in bivariate contour ellipse area 95%., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in Contrast Sensitivity Score at Month 12 in Study Eye, Change in contrast sensitivity was assessed by Pelli-Robson chart which uses a single large letter size (20/60 optotype), with contrast varying across groups of letters (6 per line), whose contrast varies from high to low. Participants read letters, starting with highest contrast, until they are unable to read 2 or 3 letters in a single group. Each group had three letters of the same contrast level, so there were three trials per contrast level. Score is assigned based on contrast of last group in which 2 or 3 letters were correctly read. Score is a measure of participant's log contrast sensitivity ranging from 0 (no letters read) to 2.25 (all letters read). Total CS score=\[(total letters correct-3) x 0.05\]. A negative change from baseline indicates worsening in contrast sensitivity score., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in Colour Vision Total Error Score at Month 12 in Study Eye, Colour vision total error scores were assessed by the Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue Sort Test. Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue Test requires placing 100 colour palettes in the correct order based upon colour hue. Scores are determined by the frequency and severity of any displacement in the correct order. One error equates to one misplaced hue, by one step or position. An error score of 0 indicates no errors in ordering the hues while error score greater than 500 indicates virtually no color discrimination. A Total Error Score of 0 to 128 could be seen in a normal population., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in Reading Speed Test at Month 12 in Study Eye, The reading speed (words per minute) was calculated using the following formula: \[number of words in the text - number of misread words\] / reading time x 60. The number of misread words and reading time is collected. A negative change from baseline indicates decline in reading speed., Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in the 25-Item Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-25) Composite Scores at Month 12 in Study Eye, VFQ-25 consists of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions representing 11 vision-related constructs, plus an additional single-item general health rating question. All items are scored so that a high score represents better functioning. Each item is then converted to a 0 to 100 scale so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. A score of 0 represents the worst outcome and 100 represents the best outcome. A negative change from baseline indicates decline in VFQ-25 score., Baseline, Month 12",,Biogen,,MALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,169,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,273CH301|2015-003958-41,2017-12-11,2020-12-01,2020-12-01,2018-04-12,2023-11-15,2023-12-07,"Research Site, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|Research Site, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|Research Site, Baltimore, Maryland, 21287, United States|Research Site, New York, New York, 10032, United States|Research Site, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45242, United States|Research Site, Portland, Oregon, 97232, United States|Research Site, Dallas, Texas, 75231, United States|Research Site, Madison, Wisconsin, 53705, United States|Research Site, Montréal, H3A 0E7, Canada|Research Site, Vancouver, V5Z 3N9, Canada|Research Site, Glostrup, Denmark|Research Site, Helsinki, 00290, Finland|Research Site, Montpellier, France|Research Site, Bonn, 53127, Germany|Research Site, Tübingen, Germany|Research Site, Nijmegen, Netherlands|Research Site, Manchester, M13 9WL, United Kingdom|Research Site, Oxford, OX3 9DU, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/12/NCT03496012/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/12/NCT03496012/SAP_001.pdf"

A responder is defined as a participant with a mean improvement of at least 15% in TUG speed over 24 weeks compared to baseline. Baseline is defined as the mean at Screening and Day 1 visits. Estimated proportion obtained from binomial proportions. There are 2 TUG tests given, and the average across the 2 tests is used to calculate average speed. Healthy participants below the age of 79 are expected to complete this task in 7-10 seconds (American College of Rheumatology). Missing data are handled using multiple imputation and baseline is defined as the mean over Screening and Day 1., Baseline to Week 24|Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) Physical Score Over 24 Weeks, The 29-item MSIS-29 is a participant-reported outcome measure to assess the impact of MS on day-to-day life during the past 2 weeks from a participant's perspective; it measures 20 physical items and 9 psychological items. The physical score is generated by summing individual items and then transforming to a scale with a range of 0 (no impact of MS) to 100 (extreme impact of MS); a negative change indicates an improvement in function.

Data are based on a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) model using a common variance AR(1) variance-covariance matrix structure. Treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction were included in the model as explanatory variables, adjusting for screening EDSS, baseline MSIS-29 physical score and prior aminopyridine as covariates. Missing data are handled using multiple imputation and baseline is defined as the mean over screening and Day 1., Baseline to Week 24|Change From Baseline in Berg Balance Scale (BBS) Over 24 Weeks, The BBS is a widely used assessment tool to identify balance impairment. Functional activities such as reaching, bending, transferring, and standing are evaluated on the test to evaluate balance. Participants are asked to complete 14 tasks that are rated from 0 (cannot perform) to 4 (normal performance) for a total of 56 points. BBS scores range from 0 (poor balance) to 56 (good balance); a positive change indicates improvement.

NCT01850095,The Influence of Peripheral Androgen Conversion at Women Adult Acne,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01850095,,UNKNOWN,"Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the pilosebaceous unit. Recent studies have demonstrated an increase number of acne cases in adult women. These cases are predominantly normoandrogenic and have some clinical differences when compared with the most common group, the adolescent. The local glandular metabolism converts some hormonal precursors to more active substances that increase the sebum production, leaving these areas more prone to increase the colonization to Propionibacterium Acnes (P. Acnes). Toll-like receptor 2, expressed by inflammatory cells play a crucial role in the innate immune response to this bacterium. Previous studies confirm that exist a reduced expression of CD1d by keratinocytes in acne lesion, what can be interpreted as a low antigen-present function. The influence of hormonal alteration in the sebaceous glands could modulate the expressions of TLR-2 and CD1d explaining the persistence of lesions in adult women. The change to more estrogenic metabolism, with use of specific contraceptive pills could normalize this immune-mediated inflammatory process.

NCT02255435,RTA 408 Capsules in Patients With Friedreich's Ataxia - MOXIe,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02255435,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia caused by triplet-repeat expansions. The causative mutation is a trinucleotide (GAA) repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene, leading to impaired transcription of frataxin. The pathological consequences of frataxin deficiency include a severe disruption of iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, mitochondrial iron overload coupled to cellular iron dysregulation, and an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress.

A hallmark of Friedreich's ataxia is impairment of antioxidative defense mechanisms, which play a major role in disease progression. Studies have demonstrated that nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling is grossly impaired in patients with Friedreich's ataxia. Therefore, the ability of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) to activate Nrf2 and induce antioxidant target genes is hypothesized to be therapeutic in patients with Friedreich's ataxia.

This 2-part study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) in the treatment of patients with Friedreich's ataxia.

Part 1: The first part of this study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) at various doses in patients with Friedreich's ataxia.

Part 2: The second part of this study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) 150 mg in patients with Friedreich's ataxia. Patients enrolled in Part 2 will be randomized 1:1 to receive omaveloxolone (RTA 408) 150 mg or placebo.

Extension: The extension will assess long-term safety and tolerability of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) in qualified patients with Friedreich's ataxia following completion of Part 1 or Part 2.

The MDBP is one of the world's largest leukodystrophy biorepositories, having enrolled nearly 2,000 affected individuals since it was launched over a decade ago.

Researchers working in the biorepository hope to use these materials to uncover new genetic etiologies for various leukodystrophies, develop biomarkers for use in future clinical trials, and better understand the natural history of these disorders. The knowledge gained from these efforts may help improve the diagnostic tools and treatment options available to patients in the future.",NO,Leukodystrophy|White Matter Disease|Leukoencephalopathies|Aicardi Goutieres Syndrome|Metachromatic Leukodystrophy|TUBB4A-Related Leukodystrophy|4H Syndrome|Krabbe Disease|Alexander Disease|Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease|Adrenoleukodystrophy|Adrenomyeloneuropathy|Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency|Megalencephalic Leukoencephalopathy With Subcortical Cysts|Vanishing White Matter Disease|Cockayne Syndrome|Labrune Syndrome|ADLD|Gangliosidoses|Peroxisomal Biogenesis Disorder|Adult-Onset Leukodystrophy With Neuroaxonal Spheroids|Hereditary Diffuse Leukoencephalopathy With Spheroids,,"Define Novel Homogeneous Groups of Patients with Unclassified Leukodystrophy, In patients with an unclassified leukodystrophy, the study team will collect as much information as available from existing medical records including existing clinical evaluations, neuropsychological/rehabilitation evaluations, and results from blood, urine, spinal fluid, radiological, and peripheral tissue pathological tests. This data will be evaluated to create nosologic groups amongst patients with unclassified leukodystrophy.

In such patients, in order to access the intrathecal space, US guidance and/or assistance have been recently proposed as useful and successful tool. The US guidance and/or assistance have been associated to a high success rate, a reduction of number of attempts and needle passes to obtain a successful anesthesia. A reduced risk of adverse events (AEs), such as post dural puncture headache (PDPH) and low back pain (LBP), and low patient satisfaction often associated with multiple needle punctures was also reported.

Aim of this retrospective study was to report the efficacy, evaluated as rate of the successful procedures and subsequent delivery of nusinersen within the subarachnoid space, the number of attempts, the procedure time and the adverse events (AEs) of interlaminar intrathecal nusinersen administration using either ultrasound assistance or the landmark-based technique in a historical cohort of 51 adult SMA patients.",NO,"Anesthesia, Spinal|Spinal Puncture Complications|Spinal Muscular Atrophy|Ultrasonography",PROCEDURE: Interlaminar ultrasound-assisted intrathecal administration of nusinersen|PROCEDURE: Landmark-based intrathecal administration of nusinersen,"Number of successful administrations, Defined as a confirmation of the CSF flow through the spinal needle and subsequent administration of whole drug, During the procedure|Number of attempts, Defined as the number of needle insertions through the skin surface, During the procedure|Procedure time, The time in minutes from the start of US imaging or the palpation of superior aspect of iliac crest to visualization of CSF flow, During the procedure|Number of technical success procedures, Defined as a successful intrathecal administration with equal or less than 4 attempts, During the procedure|Adverse events (AEs), Defined as mild AEs (Post Dural Puncture Headache, Low Back Pain) or severe AEs (spinal cord injury/epidural hematoma, abdominal organ lesions), In the first 72 hours after the procedure",,,Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,51,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,EchoSpin,2022-12-16,2023-01-10,2023-01-10,2022-12-09,,2023-03-09,"Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli, Roma, RM, Italy",

NCT04580381,Real World Effectiveness of Natalizumab Extended Interval Dosing in a French Cohort,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04580381,RELEVANT,COMPLETED,"Natalizumab (NTZ) use in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in highly active patients has been largely established during the last Rationale 10 years in both clinical trials and real-world practice. Along with its efficacy, NTZ use has been limited by potential risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Thus, several studies have tried to assess how to minimize this risk.

One suggested approach is to move from the standard interval dose (SID) of 4 weeks to an extended interval dose (EID) of 5 weeks or longer. Extending the dosing interval of NTZ has been practiced by some physicians with the intention of improving the benefit/risk of the treatment by reducing the exposure-dependent risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) while maintaining efficacy. We propose to retrospectively analyze data from clinical records coming from RRMS patients treated in France at 5 different centers; Caen, Nice, Bobigny and Toulouse hospitals as well as Percy Military Hospital, to evaluate the effectiveness of natalizumab EID in subjects who have previously been treated with natalizumab SID for 12 months, in relation to continued SID treatment. In the clinical practice of these centers, patients are shifted after minimum 12 months under SID to an EID of 6 weeks regardless antibody JC serum status.

However, it may be reactivated in people who have a decreased immune function as in HIV infection, cancer, chemotherapy, transplant recipients, or in MS patients treated with natalizumab (Tysabri). In these patients, JC virus can cause a severe brain disease called Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), for which there is no cure.

As of September 2013, 400 MS patients in the world, who have been treated with natalizumab, have developed PML. The risk of PML is approximately 5 patients in 1000 after 24 months on the drug. Researchers do not know exactly in which cells of the body the virus lives but it has been isolated from the blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and from the brains of patients with immunosuppression.

In this study, the investigators wish to determine precisely where the virus lives, and how the body prevents it from causing brain disease.

Because of the association of PML with natalizumab, the investigators would like to see if there is a difference in the amounts of virus in blood, urine, and CSF found in MS patients treated with natalizumab or those treated with different medications for MS, or those not treated at all.

Laboratory test parameters include hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, follicle stimulating hormone, urine drug screen, and pregnancy test., Screening up to Week 12 or early termination|Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings, ECG criteria of potential clinical concern: 1) QRS interval (time from ECG Q wave to the end of the S wave corresponding to ventricle depolarization): greater than or equal to (\>=) 140 milliseconds (msec), \>=50% increase from baseline; 2) PR interval (the interval between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex, corresponding to the time between the onset of the atrial depolarization and onset of ventricular depolarization): \>=300 msec, \>=25% increase when baseline is greater than (\>) 200 msec or \>=50% increase when baseline is less than or equal to (\<=) 200 msec; 3) QTcF interval (time from ECG Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole corrected using Fridericia's formula): absolute value of 450 to less than (\<) 480 msec, 480 to \<500 msec, \>=500 msec; an increase from baseline of 30 to \<60 msec or \>=60 msec., Screening up to Week 12 or early termination|Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Vital Signs Findings, Vital signs criteria of potential clinical concern: 1) systolic blood pressure \<90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg); 2) change from baseline of systolic blood pressure \>=30 mm Hg; 3) diastolic blood pressure \<50 mm Hg; 4) change from baseline of diastolic blood pressure \>=20 mm Hg; 5) supine pulse rate \<40 or \>120 beats per minute (bpm); 6) standing pulse rate \<40 or \>140 bpm., Screening up to Week 12 or early termination|Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Neurological Examination, The extended neurological examination includes observation for cerebellar (intention) tremor and for non-cerebellar tremors (eg, resting or positional), finger nose, heel shin, Romberg, tandem walking, positional and gaze-evoked nystagmus, reflexes, muscle strength, cranial nerves, sensory function of upper and lower extremities. The brief neurological examination includes an assessment of motor and sensory function, cranial nerves, reflexes, non-cerebellar tremor (eg, resting or positional) and cerebellar function. The assessment of cerebellar function is complemented by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), a clinical scale based on a semi-quantitative assessment of cerebellar ataxia on an impairment level., Screening up to Week 12 or early termination|Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Physical Examination, A full physical examination includes head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems.

This will allow investigators to evaluate how much contrast has crossed into the tissue surrounding the brain. Such information will help investigators determine whether this kind of contrast can be used to model how other drugs might travel through the CNS and evaluate its use as an illustrative imaging marker that mirrors the glymphatic system.",NO,Healthy,OTHER: MR Imaging|OTHER: CT-guidance,"Drug distribution over time, The drug distribution of gadolinium contrast throughout the Central Nervous System over time (12 hours), 6 time-points over 12 hours",,,Weill Medical College of Cornell University,Biogen,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,19,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,1609017536,2017-02-06,2018-02-06,2018-02-08,2017-07-14,,2018-02-12,"Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, 10021, United States",
